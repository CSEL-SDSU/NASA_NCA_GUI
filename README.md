# NASA_NCA_GUI

>> dependencies/serial connection contain files required to compile the executables

>> executables contains packaged versions of the GUI

>> versions contains matlab application files of previous versions of the GUI

> To make changes to the GUI and package a new version, the dependencies/serial connections folders
  must be downloaded. Editing is done through one of the matlab application (.mlapp) files. It is
  recommended to create a new mlapp file when making changes to preserve older versions.

> The files contained in executables are ready to use versions provided you have the correct matlab
  runtime environment installed on the computer. Information on which runtime version is required can
  be found in the readme.txt file within the package.
